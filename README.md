# Product Design using Design Sprint

Design Sprint is an open-source resource delveloped by Google Ventures for design leaders, product owners, developers or anyone who is learning about or running Design Sprints.


* The Design Sprint is a proven methodology for solving problems through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users. 

* Design Sprints quickly align teams under a shared vision with clearly defined goals and deliverables. 

* Ultimately, it is a tool for developing a hypothesis, prototyping an idea, and testing it rapidly with as little investment as possible in as real an environment as possible.

The Design Sprint follows six phases: **Understand, Define, Sketch, Decide, Prototype, and Validate**.

In this Design Sprint project, I will be going through the exercises and we will discuss methods to simulate some of the group activities related to brainstorming.

Product Scenario:

Lets call this new feature as **LinkedInGrad-carrers for freshers**
